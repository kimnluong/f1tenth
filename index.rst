f1tenth - build documentation
================================================

Welcome to the official build documentation of `F1tenth <http://f1tenth.org/>`_. 

If you want to learn how to make the vehicle, :ref:`Getting Started <doc_build_intro>` walks through how to build the car from ground up. It will also explain how to install all of the required firmware and software.

If you already have a working car and the work environment set up, then check out :ref:`Going Forward <doc_going_forward_intro>` to learn how to install the simulator and implement some fun algorithms.

Join in the discussion with us on Slack! There, you can ask build questions, bring up software concerns, look for competition updates, and much more.
