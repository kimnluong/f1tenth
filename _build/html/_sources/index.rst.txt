    .. note:: Godot's documentation is available in various languages and versions.
              Expand the "Read the Docs" panel at the bottom of the sidebar to see
              the list.

    .. attention:: This is the documentation for the development (master) branch.
                   Looking for the documentation of the current **stable** branch?
                   `Have a look here <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable>`_.

  .. only:: i18n

    .. note:: This documentation is translated from the `original English one
              <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest>`_ by community members
              on `Weblate <https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/godot-engine/godot-docs>`_.

              Depending on the translation effort's completion level, you may
              find paragraphs or whole pages which are still in English. You can
              help the community by providing new translations or reviewing existing
              ones on Weblate.

              For the time being, localized translations are only available for
              the "latest" (development) branch, but should be suitable to learn
              how to use stable Godot releases nevertheless.
