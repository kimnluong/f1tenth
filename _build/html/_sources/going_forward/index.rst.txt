Introduction
==================

Now that you've built the car, a whole world of possibilities begin. Here are a few additional add ons that would make things a lot more interesting and fun. This section will go over how to implement a few algorithms and get a simulator working on the host laptop.

Here is where you will all the information needed to get started. This build documentation is divided into three main sections:

#. :ref:`Setting up the Simulator <doc_going_forward_simulation>` 
#. :ref:`Algorithms <doc_going_forward_algorithms>`
