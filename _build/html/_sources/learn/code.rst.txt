Code
========

Our fun and informative lectures walk you through all the steps to get your car moving, driving straight, making turns and taking loops. This gets you to the baseline autonomous operation of the vehicle. The course takes 2-3 weeks and then you are ready to build on top of the software to win the race. No prior knowledge is assumed and this is a course meant to make autonomous systems available and accessible. Ask questions on the Forum.
